<p>MIDDLETON'S RESOLVE</p>


<p>"I shall go down to Wokingham", said Middleton, "a few days 
before the election, and the Major will stay here. I 
understand that there will be no other candidate, and _I_
shall take the seat.</p>

<p>"The Major is a . . . _flaneur_. He has no interest beyond 
his own advancement. I can buy him for a hundred pounds. 
_Here_ is his answer."</p>

<p>Wallace wondered at the _hubris_ of his friend, and 
examined the note Middleton thrust upon him.</p>

<p>"Sir,
    No consideration would induce me to
change my resolve in this matter, but I am
willing to engage your services as my agent
for a fee of 100 pounds.
                     H. Middleton"</p>



<p>CHAPTER IV</p>

<p>THE ELECTION</p>

  <p>Now hatred is by far the longest pleasure;
      Men love in haste, but they detest at leisure.
                                    ---- BYRON</p>

<p>On hearing of Middleton's visit, Mr. Wentworth began his 
preparations. Meeting with Thomas Lake and Riley at the 
back of the tap-room of The Bull &amp; Gate--where the landlord
saw to it that they remained undisturbed--he laid out their
plan of campaign.</p>

<p>"That d---l Middleton shall not have the seat," he raved,
"not for Lord H------; no, nor for a hundred Lords! We 
shall see to it that every man's hand is turned against
him when he arrives."</p>

<p>Lake unfolded a paper from his vest-pocket and smoothed it
on the table. "Here are the expenses we should undertake."
