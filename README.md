# Project Gutenberg Website

This is the source content, database, and other internal files used for building the [gutenberg.org](https://www.gutenberg.org) website.

This is a `git` repository hosted on Github at https://github.com/gutenbergtools/gutenbergsite.


## Development

If you wish to experiment you can develop and run the site on your local machine.

Dependencies:

* [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) language
* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) static website generator
* Git

Once Ruby, Jekyll, and Git are setup:

    git clone https://github.com/gutenbergtools/gutenbergsite.git
    cd gutenbergsite
    bundle exec jekyll serve

Then open your web browser to http://localhost:4000


### Further Information

Any user logged into github may submit pull requests. 

If you are new to Github and git repositories, please first read the Github [Quick Start](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/quickstart) guide.

If you are new to Jekyll, get started by reading the [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).


## Static Site Generation

We use Jekyll to convert pages from github-flavored markdown to HTML, applying our styles.

The static files are generated directly on the Project Gutenberg site. Use the designated `username` to edit files and generate the site.

To make it easier to track where things are, we use the same structure and filenames as the live site. For example, `site/about/index.md` will correspond to `about/index.html` for the live site.  However, the actual filename and path is in the markdown file (the first lines at the top of the `.md` files): Jekyll does not build the directory structure you use, instead it follows the metadata at the top of the markdown files.

Content that should be copied as-is to the live site is put at the the top-level of `$BASEDIR/gutenbergsite`.  For example, we have a directory `catalog` for the catalog interface, and `gutenberg` for the site assets (CSS and pictures).

Use the `keep_files` variable in Jekyll's `_config.yml` for anything that is not part of the `gutenbergsite` repo but is maintained separately in `$BASEDIR/html`. This includes symlinks. Anything with usernames, passwords, codes, or other private information should not be added to the `gutenbergsite` repo.

The basic setup is:

* `$BASEDIR`: the path where we maintain the site.
* `$BASEDIR/gutenbergsite`: the git-maintained content
* `$BASEDIR/html`: the path on the server that the web server uses as its `DOCUMENT ROOT`.
* `$BASEDIR/gutenbergdev`: corresponding place for the dev server.

Most pages for the live site (i.e., under `$BASEDIR/html`) should exist under `$BASEDIR/gutenbergsite`. Any exceptions will be noted in `$BASEDIR/gutenbergsite/_config.yml` (the Jekyll configuration file).

To update the git-maintained content and push to the live site:

Running jekyll takes just a few seconds:

* `$EBCBIN/cron-jekyll.sh` (runs jekyll) This is run hourly by cron. It does not do the git pull.
* `$EBCBIN/dev-jekyll.sh` (pulls and runs the dev branch jekyll targeting the dev server directory)
* `$EBCBIN/prod-jekyll.sh` (pulls and runs the master branch jekyll targeting the prod server directory)

Any changes to files under `gutenbergsite` should be checked in via git. But please don't edit files on the production server! Changes should be made via github.com

Pages that will be converted from markdown to HTML (and have our header/footer added) are in `$BASEDIR/gutenbergsite/site` (www) or `$BASEDIR/gutenbergdev/site` (dev).

## Getting the rest of the static files made

The non-jekyll pages take a few minutes to build. There are more than a hundred pages which query the database and/or process log files:

* `$EBCBIN/make-static-pages` (builds non-jekyll pages) This script runs twice a day. 
* `$EBCBIN/make-static-pages-dev` (does the same for the dev branch targeting the directory used for the dev site)


Some of the code that makes the PG website pages was developed as early as 2010, using PHP, Perl and a bit of Python. We are currently building scaffolding to make the page generation and testing less ad hoc and more consistent with modern devops.

### Browse pages

`make-static-pages` sets the environment and runs make-by-pages.php from this repo.
The "score" pages are made by cron-analog (called by make-static-pages), which uses download data to determine the most popular books. 

The "Pretty Pictures" page is currently in rehab. It used a google API which was recently turned off, over 12 years after its announced deprecation!
