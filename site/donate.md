Project Gutenberg Needs Your Donation
=====================================

Thank you for considering a donation to Project Gutenberg.

Think of this as a contribution to later generations. These are remarkable times, and it is good to include you as part of the story.

Project Gutenbergâ€™s founder, Michael Hart, was notoriously frugal. He never wanted to be dependent on specific funding levels, and instead insisted that Project Gutenberg would continue even if it had no funds. In support of this, he went for years without reliable income.

Project Gutenberg appreciates all donations. They help to operate our minimalist infrastructure, to pay our tiny staff, and most importantly to support volunteers who create new free eBooks.

The design of Project Gutenberg is that everything at www.gutenberg.org will always be free and available for unlimited redistribution at no cost.

## <a name="using-paypal"></a> Option 1 - Via Paypal
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="new">
  Make a <strong>one-time</strong> donation:
  <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" >
  <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="XKAL6BZL3YPSN" >
    <input type="image" src="/pics/en_US.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="One-time donation by PayPal" style="vertical-align: middle">

<input type="hidden" name="on0" value="Monthly donation amount" >
<input type="hidden" name="currency_code" value="USD" >

Make a <strong>monthly donation</strong> (cancel any time): 

<select name="os0">
      <option value="Five dollars">Five dollars : $5.00USD</option>
      <option value="Ten dollars">Ten dollars : $10.00USD</option>
      <option value="Fifteen dollars">Fifteen dollars : $15.00USD</option>
      <option value="Twenty dollars">Twenty dollars : $20.00USD</option>
      <option value="Twenty-five dollars">Twenty-five dollars : $25.00USD</option>
      <option value="One hundred dollars">One hundred dollars : $100.00USD</option>
</select>

<input type="image" src="/pics/btn_subscribe_SM.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="Subscription donation by PayPal" style="vertical-align: middle">

</form>

PayPal accepts credit cards, checks, and bank transfer payments. You will need to make a PayPal account.

In addition to using the quick donation links above, you can also login into PayPal and select "Send Money." When prompted, specify 'donate2025@pglaf.org' as recipient and send the payment as you would any other.

The fee charged by PayPal is their discounted rate for charities, which is 1.99% of the transaction plus 49 cents per transaction. So don't bother with $1 amounts - only $0.49 will reach us!

Unfortunately donations from some countries don't work when using the PayPal buttons above. Even in those cases, the more direct "Send Money" to 'donate2025@pglaf.org' method still works perfectly well though.

## <a name="using-buymeacoffee"></a> Option 2 - Via BuyMeACoffee

Visit <a href="https://BuyMeACoffee.com/projgutenberg">BuyMeACoffee.com/projgutenberg</a> to make a one-time donation or to sign up for a monthly donation. Cancel any time.

BuyMeACoffee requires no registration and supports the major Payment providers, including Visa and MasterCard. 100% of your donation will reach Project Gutenberg.

You can donate in any increment of $5, which is envisioned as the nominal cost of a (rather fancy) cup of coffee. You can learn more about the platform here: <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/faq">FAQ page</a>.

Project Gutenberg is provided with your name and donation amount, but not with your contact information. So, unfortunately we are unable to send you a "thank you" note.


<br>
## <a name="by-check-or-money-order"></a> Option 3 - Check or Money Order (any currency)

Send a check or money order (any currency) to:

<dl><dd>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</dd>
<dd>41 Watchung Plaza, #516</dd>
<dd>  Montclair, NJ 07042</dd></dl>

The bank we utilize, Wells Fargo, does not charge any fees for our bank account. They do charge a fee for processing non-US funds. This fee is difficult to know in advance, but usually seems to be five dollars or slightly more for checks of at least $USD 100 in value. The exchange rate to US funds is at market value.

Any donation of $100 or over will receive a written "thank you" via postal mail, unless you do not provide a return address.

Note that since fall 2023 we have had problems with some mail sent to our USPS post office box being delayed significantly. Delays of up to 6 months have occurred. This has been frustrating for donors, as well as for Project Gutenberg.
