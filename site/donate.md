Project Gutenberg Needs Your Donation
=====================================

Thank you for considering a donation to Project Gutenberg.

Think of this as a contribution to later generations. These are remarkable times, and it is good to include you as part of the story.  The [Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation](/about/pglaf.html) is registered as a 501(c)(3) charity under the United States Internal Revenue Code, so your donation is tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.

## <a name="free"></a>Project Gutenberg is always free!

Project Gutenberg appreciates donations. They help to operate our minimalist infrastructure and pay our tiny staff, and most importantly to support volunteers who create new eBooks.

The design of Project Gutenberg is that it will always be free: the content is available for unlimited free redistribution, and the main website is hosted without fees by <a href="https://www.ibiblio.org" target="_blank">iBiblio</a>.

Project Gutenberg's founder, Michael Hart, was notoriously frugal. He never wanted to be dependent on specific funding levels, and instead insisted that Project Gutenberg would continue even if it had no funds. In support of this, he went for years without reliable income.

Donations help Project Gutenberg to support its activity and augment its message, and to maintain the pace of around 200 new titles per month. There will never be a cost to access Project Gutenberg's content, and everything at www.gutenberg.org will always be available for unlimited free redistribution.


## <a name="experiment"></a>Fundraising Experiment with Give Freely

Project Gutenberg is working with <a href="https://givefreely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Give Freely</a> to provide options for readers to generate donations of funds.

The Give Freely model is to install a browser extension. The extension automatically detects when you visit a participating online merchant. Then, if you make a purchase, a donation is channeled from that merchant to your selected charity. There is no cost to you. The browser extension also helps to find coupons in the online merchant sites.

Give Freely has a mission and philosophy that emphasizes <a href="https://givefreely.com/transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">transparency</a> and accountability.

This donation method is currently only available for people in the United States who are using the Chrome or Edge browser. Project Gutenberg has a (Google-hosted) <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvk_QEXMmSWr042oJJ-HQf9JxGFJADEh5HJxTfOldQ-k0vLg/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="noopener noreferrer">feedback form</a> for any input you might have about using the Give Freely donation platform.

The Give freely browser extension can be disabled or uninstalled at any time.

## <a name="#additional-detail-on-how-to-donate"></a>Additional Detail on How To Donate

Project Gutenberg's success is due to the hard work of thousands of volunteers over more than 50 years. Your donations make it possible to support these volunteers, and pay our expenses to continue the creation of free electronic texts.

Donations are made to the [Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation](/about/pglaf.html), a non-profit corporation registered in the US State of Mississippi. PGLAF is approved as a charitable 501(c)(3) organization by the US Internal Revenue Service, and has the Federal Employee Information Number (EIN) 64-6221541.

There are several ways to donate. We want you to make a donation in the best way for you, so have tried to make it easy.

In summary, BuyMeACoffee or PayPal are usually the easiest and most flexible payment methods.  We can also accept mailed checks or money orders in any national currency, and a few other methods.  If you want to make a donation in a way that's not specified below, please contact us!  PGLAF has participated in some employee matching programs, Benevity, and others.

### <a name="using-buymeacoffee"></a>About donations by BuyMeACoffee
<a name="about-donations-by-buymeacoffee"></a>BuyMeACoffee (or Buy Me A Coffee) is a website for donations that provides 100% of all donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. It requires no registration for donors.

You can donate in any increment of $5. Five American dollars is envisioned as the nominal cost of a (rather fancy) cup of coffee. You can learn more about this donation platform on their <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/faq">FAQ page</a>.

Project Gutenberg is provided with your name and the donation amount, but is not provided your contact information (email, Twitter, or any other identification that you might have submitted. So, we cannot send a "thank you" note.

If you need a tax receipt, be sure to save the payment information from the Buy Me A Coffee website.

### <a name="about-donations-by-paypal"></a>About donations by PayPal
<a name="about-donations-by-paypal"></a>PayPal is a Web site that accepts credit cards, checks, and bank transfer payments.  You need to set up a PayPal account to donate via PayPal (in the past, you could donate without setting up an account.  This doesn't seem to be possible any more). Visa, MasterCard, Amex and Discover are accepted.  Because of PayPal's fees, any donation of under 32 cents or so doesn't reach PGLAF.  Instead, consider letting your small donations add up to a dollar or more before sending it with PayPal.

In addition to using the quick donation links above, you can also login to PayPal and select "Send Money." When prompted, specify 'donate2024@pglaf.org' as the recipient, and you will be presented with PGLAF's information. Send the payment as you would any other payment. Funds go directly to PGLAF via PayPal.  Any national currency is OK.

Be assured that you will not be added to any postal or email list or solicited further. You will get a "thank you" email from the CEO, and that is all. You are invited to subscribe to the email lists, but we do not subscribe you directly.

This emailed thank you and your PayPal transaction record serve as your tax receipt for your donation. 

The fee charged by PayPal for your donation is their discounted rate for registered charities.  This is 2.2% of the transaction plus 30 cents per transaction. For a $100 payment, this amounts to $2.50 or 2.5%. For $10, the fee is $0.52 or 5.2%. PayPal accepts non-US accounts and funds.


### <a name="about-donating-by-check-or-money-order"></a>About donating by Check or Money Order
<a name="about-donating-by-check-or-money-order"></a>Send a check or money order in US funds. Our address is:

<dl><dd> Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation<br /></dd>
<dd> PO Box 16327<br /></dd>
<dd> Salt Lake City, UT 84116</dd></dl>

The bank we utilize, Wells Fargo, does not charge any fees for our use of the bank account. They do charge a fee of at least $5 for depositing checks from outside the US or in non-US currency. Any donation of $100 or over will receive a written "thank you" via postal mail, unless you do not provide a return address.

This written thank you and your cancelled check serve as your tax receipt for your donation. 

### <a name="about-donating-by-non-us-funds-check-or-money-order"></a>About donating by Non-US Funds Check or Money Order
<a name="about-donating-by-non-us-funds-check-or-money-order"></a>Send a check or money order in non-US funds. This can go to the same address as above. The bank charges a fee for processing non-US funds. This fee is difficult to know in advance, but usually seems to be five dollars or slightly more for checks of at least $USD 100 in value. The exchange rate to US funds is at market value.

## <a name="about-donating-by-non-us-funds-check-or-money-order"></a>Privacy Policy For Donations
<a name="privacy-policy-for-donations"></a>In order to meet IRS tax regulations, PGLAF keeps track of the names, addresses, donation amounts and donation methods of non-anonymous donors. We normally send a postal or email "thank you" letter when we receive your donation over $100.

We do not provide any information about donors to any party outside of PGLAF and its employees and contractors for any purpose, except if required by law. We will not send subsequent postal or electronic mail or attempt to phone you. We do not add you to any mailing list or email list. If you would like to subscribe to one of the Project Gutenberg email lists to receive the monthly newsletter or immediate notificaions of new eBooks, please visit [our mailing list pages](https://lists.pglaf.org) for instructions.
