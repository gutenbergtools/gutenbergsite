Project Gutenberg Needs Your Donation
=====================================

Thank you for considering a donation to Project Gutenberg.

Think of this as a contribution to later generations. These are remarkable times, and it is good to include you as part of the story.

Your donations make it possible to pay our basic expenses and support our volunteers to continue the creation of free electronic texts.

The design of Project Gutenberg is that everything at www.gutenberg.org will always be free and available for unlimited redistribution at no cost.


<br>
## <a name="using-paypal"></a> Option 1 - Via Paypal
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="new">
  Make a <strong>one-time</strong> donation:
  <input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" >
  <input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="XKAL6BZL3YPSN" >
    <input type="image" src="/pics/en_US.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="One-time donation by PayPal" style="vertical-align: middle">
</form>

<form action="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr" method="post" target="new">

<input type="hidden" name="cmd" value="_s-xclick" >
<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="EAKP47JLLM5V2" >
<input type="hidden" name="on0" value="Monthly donation amount" >
<input type="hidden" name="currency_code" value="USD" >

Make a <strong>monthly donation</strong> (cancel any time): 

<select name="os0">
      <option value="One dollar">One dollar : $1.00USD</option>
      <option value="Five dollars">Five dollars : $5.00USD</option>
      <option value="Ten dollars">Ten dollars : $10.00USD</option>
      <option value="Fifteen dollars">Fifteen dollars : $15.00USD</option>
      <option value="Twenty dollars">Twenty dollars : $20.00USD</option>
      <option value="Twenty-five dollars">Twenty-five dollars : $25.00USD</option>
      <option value="One hundred dollars">One hundred dollars : $100.00USD</option>
</select>

<input type="image" src="/pics/btn_subscribe_SM.gif" border="0" name="submit" alt="Subscription donation by PayPal" style="vertical-align: middle">

</form>

PayPal accepts credit cards, checks, and bank transfer payments. You will need to make a PayPal account.

In addition to using the quick donation links above, you can also login into PayPal and select "Send Money." When prompted, specify 'donate2025@pglaf.org' as recipient and send the payment as you would any other.

The fee charged by PayPal is their discounted rate for charities, which is 2.2% of the transaction plus 30 cents per transaction.

Unfortunately donations from some countries don't work when using the PayPal buttons above. Fixing this would involve using Paypal's Javascript code, which we'd rather avoid. Even in those cases, the more direct "Send Money" to 'donate2025@pglaf.org' method still works perfectly well though.

## <a name="using-buymeacoffee"></a> Option 2 - Via BuyMeACoffee

Visit <a href="https://BuyMeACoffee.com/projgutenberg">BuyMeACoffee.com/projgutenberg</a> to make a one-time donation or to sign up for a monthly donation. Cancel any time.

BuyMeACoffee requires no registration and supports the major Payment providers, including Visa and MasterCard. 100% of your donation will reach Project Gutenberg.

You can donate in any increment of $5, which is envisioned as the nominal cost of a (rather fancy) cup of coffee. You can learn more about the platform here: <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/faq">FAQ page</a>.

Project Gutenberg is provided with your name and donation amount, but not with your contact information. So, unfortunately we are unable to send you a "thank you" note.


<br>
## <a name="by-check-or-money-order"></a> Option 3 - Check or Money Order (any currency)

Send a check or money order (any currency) to:

<dl><dd>Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</dd>
<dd>PO Box 16327</dd>
<dd>Salt Lake City, UT 84116</dd></dl>

The bank we utilize, Wells Fargo, does not charge any fees for our bank account. They do charge a fee for processing non-US funds. This fee is difficult to know in advance, but usually seems to be five dollars or slightly more for checks of at least $USD 100 in value. The exchange rate to US funds is at market value.

Any donation of $100 or over will receive a written "thank you" via postal mail, unless you do not provide a return address.

Note that since fall 2023 we have had problems with some mail sent to our USPS post office box being delayed significantly. Delays of up to 6 months have occurred. This has been frustrating for donors, as well as for Project Gutenberg.

## <a name="givefreely"></a> Option 4 - Give Freely Browser Extension

<a href="https://givefreely.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Give Freely</a> helps you find coupons at over 10.000 participating online stores and automatically donates to a charity of your choice when you make a purchase using one of their coupons.

You start by installing their browser extension and specifiying your charity of choice (Project Gutenberg if you like). The extension detects when you visit a participating merchant online. Then, if you make a purchase, a donation is channeled from that merchant to your selected charity. There is no cost to you.

This donation method is currently only available for people in the United States, Canada or the UK who are using the Chrome or Edge browser. Additional browser support is coming in summer 2024.

Project Gutenberg has a (Google-hosted) <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdvk_QEXMmSWr042oJJ-HQf9JxGFJADEh5HJxTfOldQ-k0vLg/viewform?usp=sf_link" rel="noopener noreferrer">feedback form</a> for any input you might have about using the Give Freely donation platform.
