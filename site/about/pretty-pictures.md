N.B. The difference between this graph and the figure on the Top 100 page is explained thus: If one IP address downloads one book in two or more file formats (eg. 42.txt and 42.html) it counts as one downloaded book on the Top 100 page, while it counts as two or more downloaded file formats in this graph.
