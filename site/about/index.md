About Project Gutenberg
=======================

Project Gutenberg is an online library of more than 75,000 free eBooks.

Michael Hart, founder of Project Gutenberg, invented eBooks in 1971 and his memory continues to inspire the creation of eBooks and related content today.

Since then, thousands of volunteers have digitized and diligently proofread the world's literature. The entire Project Gutenberg collection is yours to enjoy.

All Project Gutenberg eBooks are completely free and always will be.
