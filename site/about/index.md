About Project Gutenberg
=======================

Project Gutenberg is an online library of more than 75,000 free eBooks.

It was founded in 1971 by Michael Hart, who invented the first-ever eBook.

Since then, thousands of our volunteers have digitized and diligently proofread the world's literature for you.

In doing so our focus has been on older works whose US copyright has expired.

Today after more than 50 years our collection has over 75,000 titles all of which you can download or directly read online.

All Project Gutenberg eBooks are completely free and always will be. If you'd like to support our work, we welcome any [donation](/donate/).

## Project Gutenberg Mission Statement

*To encourage the creation and distribution of eBooks.*

[A 2004 essay](/about/background/mission_statement.html) by Michael Hart provides more detail on the mission statement, and some of the beliefs that guide Project Gutenberg's activities in fulfillment of that mission.
