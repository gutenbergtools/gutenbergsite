## Mourning -> Celebrating



## Tributes and Thanks from our Community

### Notes sent with donations

I didn't know Greg, but the description I just read about him makes him sound irreplaceable.   That being said, please try! 

In memory of Greg Newby, a wonderful colleague.	100.0	USD

This donation is in loving memory of Greg Newby.   I'm so grateful to have worked with Greg.   Greg is truly inspirational, a wonderful role model, and a kind person.   Sending my heartfelt condolences to Ilana and all of Greg's family and friends.

In memory of Dr.   Greg Newby.   Thanks for the fries with mustard & introducing me to the world of public domain books.

In Memory of Greg Newby in support of his wife Ilana.   May his work and contributions continue on.   

In honor of Greg Newby.   Greg was my classmate and friend at Schreiber High School.   I last saw Greg at our 2013 reunion where, along with our friends, we danced to our favorite 80's music.   

When I was 10, My father gave me a set of Dave Dawson books that were his when he was a child.   I just found them on your site.   Now they are on my ebook reader.   I think there are a couple I didn't have.   Time to go down memory lane.

Donation is given with love in memory of my cousin Greg Newby.

Sad to hear of the passing of Greg Newby.   Sorry it's not much.   Hope his loved ones are taking care of themselves as best they can.

In the memory of Greg Newby whom I was honored to know, and for the persistence of PG.

### From Newsletter Responses

A lot of people might not know that Greg was also eService’s unofficially official beach volleyball team captain! Our department has an annual staff barbecue and beach volleyball tournament. Greg was always the first to put out a call to get everyone out at lunch to practice before the event.

Newby served as a co-organizer for the conference Hackers on Planet Earth (HOPE) for many years. He presented about hacker ethics in 2000 and "hacker" as a positive term in 2002. At HOPE XV in 2024, he spoke about opportunities to mitigate climate change. <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_B._Newby>

"Writing code can instrument our ethics." <https://youtu.be/sYfYqDPYhWc>

That is pretty rough. I wish him the best, although I have no idea what "prayers" are or would do.

Much thanks to Greg and what he has done for PG.

This is a project that has quietly influenced my career and life as well as the lives and technology and careers of many others.

Greg Newby has also been serving generously as Editor for the Open Grid Forum for many years, guiding many groups through the process of creating the many public documents available at https://ogf.org/documents and lately contributing to uploading standards ready for broader adoption to other standards developing organizations. We appreciate these contributions deeply and also wish to convey our deep thanks and regards.

Thank you @gbnewby I am really grateful for your generous work.

I know @gbnewby from his time as CTO of #ComputeCanada during a time where we went from having thirty-plus #HPC clusters of various sizes in >20 data centres to having only four big systems in as many data centres.
My thoughts go out to Greg and his family and I wish them all the strength they need in such a difficult time!

### From Social media

Greg led the document preparation process for @OpenGridForum for nearly two decades and helped in many ways from small to large in getting the majority of the publications in <https://ogf.org/documents> reviewed by the community and published for the betterment of the community. He was a tremendous contributor and friend, and he will be missed.

The entire @openlibrary.org team would like to express our deep sadness at the loss of our friend Greg Newby who, for years, has seeded @gutenberg.org  with public good, open access values worth continuing to follow. Thank you for your beautiful contributions. You are missed. -Brewster Kahle

Thank you, Greg, your accomplishments on Project Gutenberg were substantial, good natured, and selfless.

Following our good friend Michael Hart on the vision of having all books available in all languages, the PG set was the starting point for every ereader, every AI project, every digital humanities project.

I remember him as the guy who insisted fries with mustard are great. He was kind of right & kind of wrong because mayonnaise & mustard was better . Ofc also introduced me into the world of public domain (e)-books & Gutenberg project.

Will make some fries with mustard in his honour. My condolences to his friends & family 

We are deeply saddened by the loss of Greg Newby, who led Project Gutenberg ( @gutenberg.org ) with passion and purpose. Greg’s belief in free and open access to knowledge continues to inspire us and so many others working to preserve our shared culture online. - Internet Archive

Lots of online public-good projects don't outlast their founders. I'm grateful for Greg Newby's leadership of Project Gutenberg, which has been crucial for sustaining the project for years both before and after Michael Hart's passing.

Now I mourn Greg's own passing, and wish the best for Eric Hellman and the Project Gutenberg board, volunteers, and contributors to keep providing free, accessible literature online for many more years to come. 

We join others in mourning the loss of Dr. Greg Newby, Project Gutenberg’s leader. We are indebted to @gutenberg.org 's essential and historic role to make published materials available online and to Greg's leadership for helping digital libraries evolve and thrive throughout the decades. -HathiTrust

Thank you Dr. Newby, for leading Project Gutenberg so thoughtfully. You have left us with the gift of abundance, and we are better read and informed for it. May your memory be even more of a blessing than it already is.

## Our Finances and New Address

This past week, we sent emails or letters to about 200 donors of $100 or more, which can be used for tax purposes. If you don't receive yours within a week and need a letter, please email donate@gutenberg.org. 

As you must know, Project Gutenberg is a dynamic, impactful organization that does amazing work sending out over a million free ebooks a day. It has a small budget (which we hope to grow!) financed mostly by small donations from over a thousand users, ranging from the 5 dollar bill we recently received in the mail from a schoolgirl in East Setauket, NY to *slightly* larger donations.

We've posted our recently filed 990 return for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 on the website. It shows donation income of $117,756 (not bad!) and a deficit of *-23,397* (not good). On the bright side, donations for the current fiscal year are up by ~30% over last year (very good!). The closure of our Salt Lake City office will save us a lot of money. (sad, but necessary.)
