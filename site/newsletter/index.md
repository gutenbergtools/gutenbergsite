## In the news about eBooks for November 2025

Key eBook news items and trends as November 2025 include:

AI and Copyright Lawsuits: There is news about publisher OverDrive suing OpenAI over AI training data and related copyright issues, a significant development for authors concerned about intellectual property rights.

Audiobook Growth: The rise in consumer demand for audiobooks means entrepreneurial authors and publishers are embracing an "audio-first" trend, seeking to leverage advances against audio rights while potentially self-publishing eBooks separately.

Spotify has expanded audiobook access for Premium subscribers in five additional European countries.

## Legal News: eBook Lending and Copyright

A significant legal development in late 2024 involved the Internet Archive's legal battle over its digital lending practices. The organization decided not to appeal a U.S. Court of Appeals ruling that found its "controlled digital lending" (CDL) model, which involved lending scanned digital copies of physical books, was not a "fair use" under copyright law. The case, Hachette Book Group, Inc. v. Internet Archive, was a closely watched dispute involving major publishers and had a significant impact on how libraries approach digital lending of copyrighted materials.

AI and Copyright Tensions: Mid-November saw heated debates on X about AI training data, with authors accusing OpenAI of scraping books (including public domain ones) without consent. A related lawsuit gained traction, potentially affecting how AI models handle free eBooks.

November's X conversations about PG had some trending, with users recommending Gutenberg for classics like Dracula and Meditations. A viral thread noted how public domain status means "no fees, no licenses," sparking eBook recommendation lists.

## Reflecting on Public Domain Day 2025

Last year, in November 2024, the primary focus in public domain eBooks news was centered on the impending Public Domain Day on January 1, 2025, when thousands of works from 1929 (plus 1924 sound recordings) entered into the U.S. public domain. This event has always generated significant buzz among digital libraries, authors, and readers, with platforms like Project Gutenberg and Standard eBooks preparing free eBook releases. Discussions emphasized how these additions will enrich free digital collections, allowing unrestricted sharing, adaptation, and remixing of classics. Here's a breakdown of the Major Works Entering the Public Domain 11 months ago:

These titles, now free for eBooks distribution and adaptation, include literary heavyweights from the late 1920s. Highlights featured last November:

* Ernest Hemingway’s, A Farewell to Arms  
  Iconic war novel; expected to see new eBooks editions and adaptations.

* Virginia Woolf’s, A Room of One's Own  
  Feminist essay; poised for fresh digital annotations and audiobooks.

* William Faulkner’s, The Sound and the Fury  
  Modernist masterpiece; highlights the "Roaring '20s" cultural wave entering free access.

* Agatha Christie’s The Seven Dials Mystery  
  Early detective story; boosts mystery genre.  
  <https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/75288>

* Dashiell Hammett’s, The Maltese Falcon (serialized version)  
  Hardboiled noir classic; anticipated for graphic novel and eBook remixes.

## PG AI Audiobooks coming soon!

The next-generation of PG audiobooks is coming soon. There will likely be two audiobooks per book (one male and one female). Feedback and demand have been positive. We are looking forward to continuing this collaboration. 

The team of talented, and bright collaborators, have recently made some great progress on a v2 version of the open audiobook collection. They have been working on for the past few months to expand the collection to all 70K books, through the use of LLMs to automatically determine what should be read aloud and what should not be. Unlike the previous effort, which involved a lot of manual cleaning effort, this new effort will automate that with a series of LLM prompts so that we can automatically read things more like a human would. The AI audiobooks use some newer speech models to generate recordings, and tackle the issue of male and female voices.


## Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal

> _Free Public Access to Create and Distribute eBooks via the Project Gutenberg Self Publishing system._

Project Gutenberg has focused mostly on the re-creation of paper books rather than the distribution of new authors and material, and we have spent as much of our time on finding books and doing copyright research as on eBook creation and distribution. Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal focuses solely on distribution rather than creation.

In 2011 Michael Hart and John Guagliardo created the Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal and Author’s Community, <https://self.gutenberg.org>.  Since then we have published over 20,000 titles.  For the month of November there were 107 titles submitted and 73 approved, <https://self.gutenberg.org/RecentPublications>.

If you or anyone you know, ever wished to have their title published at Project Gutenberg, visit <https://self.gutenberg.org> and join the author’s community. It is also a great place to find thousands of contemporary self-published titles.
