## In Memoriam: Greg Newby

On October 21, 2025, Dr. Greg B. Newby left us a great legacy of optimism as well as a deep sorrow for our loss. Earlier this year Greg was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer. He entered hospice care in August as treatments were unable to push the cancer to remission. He died surrounded by loved ones at his home in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada.

Greg began working with Michael Hart in the fall of 1991, contributing eBooks #41 and #59 together with his wife, Ilana. While Michael championed eBooks and the concept of “public access” to the world, Greg focused on the technical and organizational side—maintaining infrastructure, coordinating volunteers, and managing operations.

In 2000, Greg took on the role of founding CEO for the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (PGLAF), and participated in the creation of Distributed Proofreaders (DP), a collaborative project developed by key Project Gutenberg volunteers. After Michael’s passing in 2011, Greg continued to guide Project Gutenberg, PGLAF, and DP, with diplomatic grace and enduring dedication.

Over decades, admiration grew for his expertise, intellect, and passion. Greg was widely regarded for the kindness he showed everyone involved in his projects. Project Gutenberg wouldn't be what it is today, without his energy and foresight, his giving and guidance.

We ask that you remember Greg Newby as we do: a man of great optimism for humanity; with abundant patience for all; a scholar of the highest caliber; and an ultramarathoner, always ready for the next chance to race and grow - always ready to bring us along.

## Note from the Acting Executive Director

Although we knew it was coming, the loss of Greg was very heavy for us all. Behind the scenes, while Greg stepped back to care for himself and his family, innumerable volunteers from both Project Gutenberg and Distributed Proofreaders stepped up with both time and effort to make sure that Project Gutenberg continued to run smoothly and without interruption. That effort has been ongoing for months and it continues.

We still have a lot of work to do and gaps to fill. Many supporters have made donations to Project Gutenberg in Greg’s honor; these have given us a financial cushion to help address some of those gaps.

## Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal

Free Public Access to Create and Distribute eBooks via the Project Gutenberg Self Publishing system.

Project Gutenberg has focused mostly on the re-creation of paper books rather than the distribution of new authors and material, and we have spent as much of our time on finding books and doing copyright research as on eBook creation and distribution. Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal focuses solely on distribution rather than creation.

In 2011 Micheal Hart and John Guagliardo created the (Project Gutenberg Self Publishing Portal and Author’s Community](https://self.gutenberg.org).  Check out the [recent publications] (https://self.gutenberg.org/RecentPublications) there!
