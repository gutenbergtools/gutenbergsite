## PGLAF CEO Greg Newby’s Medical Status

Greg has worked on Project Gutenberg since 1991, and directed the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (PGLAF) as CEO since its founding in 2000. Greg has been the guiding hand of Project Gutenberg, and PGLAF, along with helping to launch Distributed Proofreaders, for more than 30 years.

Earlier this year Greg was diagnosed with aggressive pancreatic cancer and has recently focused his energy on fighting the cancer with the support of his friends and family.

Greg started working with Michael Hart in the fall of 1991. At the time, PG was hosted by Illinois Benedictine College. Greg contributed eBook #51. As Michael continued to advocate for eBooks and public access in the public discussions, Greg took up the ‘back office’ efforts, including technical maintenance, coordinating volunteer efforts and more. When Michael passed in 2011, Greg was the stalwart foundation that kept the Project moving forward and continuing to grow.

In 2000 Digital Proofreaders (DP) was established by a core group of PG volunteers with Greg as a champion for the project’s development. DP is now the primary source of new eBooks for PG.

All of us at PGLAF and DP wish him and his family resilience and strength, and send them our heartfelt love.


## Eric Hellman appointed interim director of PGLAF

Eric Hellman began his involvement with the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (PGLAF) 2018. Since then he has helped PG maintain and develop an array of essential software such as Ebookmaker and the gutenberg.org website.

In September he was elected to the PGLAF Board of Directors, and has been asked to serve as the acting Executive Director in support of Greg. Eric’s technical and strategic contributions have been an essential part of the technical component that keeps the Project Gutenberg website and services running. We thank you Eric, for stepping up and stepping into the role.


## Welcome to the PGLAF Board: Robert Tonsing

Robert Tonsing began volunteering with PGLAF in 2018,  He coordinates eBook releases, posting announcements to PGLAF’s internal “posted” mailing list (e.g., #75259, Jan 2025; #76911, Sep 2025), and contributes to proofreading through Distributed Proofreaders, with credits on titles like The Roswell Report: Case Closed (#63659, 2021) and The Louvre: Fifty Plates in Colour (#63719, 2020). His ongoing volunteer work supports PGLAF’s mission to digitize and distribute free eBooks.

We would like to extend a sincere welcome to Robert as the newest board member.


## Anyone can Help Make New eBooks!

Project Gutenberg was built by volunteers, and all new eBooks are the result of volunteer effort. The best way to help is to join Distributed Proofreaders. DP includes supportive forums for discussion, an online tutorial, and a variety of roles to suit different skills and interests. DP produces eBooks in many different languages.


## Distributed Proofreaders Celebrates 25th Anniversary

Congratulations to Distributed Proofreaders! October marks 25 years of this unique coordinated & distributed effort to digitize books and add them to the Project Gutenberg library. The amazing group of volunteers collectively spend massive numbers of hours making sure that great books are made available to everyone, across the planet.


## More About Project Gutenberg

* The History and Philosophy of Project Gutenberg by Michael Hart (1992) - Project Gutenberg began in 1971 when Michael Hart was given an operator’s account with computer time at the Xerox Sigma V mainframe at the Materials Research Lab at the University of Illinois. As it turned out two of a four operator crew happened to be the best friends of Michael’s and his brother. <http://gutenberg.org/about/background/history_and_philosophy.html>
