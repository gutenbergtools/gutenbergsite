## Mourning -> Celebrating

## Our Finances and New Address

This past week, we sent emails or letters to about 200 donors of $100 or more, which can be used for tax purposes. If you don't receive yours within a week and need a letter, please email donate@gutenberg.org. 

As you must know, Project Gutenberg is a dynamic, impactful organization that does amazing work sending out over a million free ebooks a day. It has a small budget (which we hope to grow!) financed mostly by small donations from over a thousand users, ranging from the 5 dollar bill we recently received in the mail from a schoolgirl in East Setauket, NY to *slightly* larger donations.

We've posted our recently filed 990 return for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 on the website. It shows donation income of $117,756 (not bad!) and a deficit of *-23,397* (not good). On the bright side, donations for the current fiscal year are up by ~30% over last year (very good!). The closure of our Salt Lake City office will save us a lot of money. (sad, but necessary.)
