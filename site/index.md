Welcome to Project Gutenberg
====================================================
<h2 class="subtitle">Project Gutenberg is a library of over 60,000 free eBooks</h2>
<div class="box_announce">  
<p><strong>This is the new Project Gutenberg site</strong>  See the <a href="/help/new_website">new website</a> page for information about currently known issues, and how to report problems or suggest changes.</p>
</div>
Choose among free epub and Kindle eBooks, download them or read them online. You will find the world's great literature here, with focus on older works for which U.S. copyright has expired. Thousands of volunteers digitized and diligently proofread the eBooks, for you to enjoy.

**Partial service outage** One of the main high-speed mirrors is temporarily unavailable (aleph.pglaf.org). We are working to recover it. The mirror at gutenberg.pglaf.org is available, but not will not receive new content until aleph is back.

**Planned service change** In April 2020, www.gutenberg.org plans to remove unencrypted access (http), and will only offer https. The collection remains available from mirrors, as well as via unencrypted ftp and rsync.

**No fee or registration!** Everything from Project Gutenberg is gratis, libre, and completely without cost to readers. If you find Project Gutenberg useful, please consider a small donation, to help Project Gutenberg digitize more books, maintain its online presence, and improve Project Gutenberg programs and offerings. Other ways to help include digitizing, proofreading and formatting, or reporting errors.

**No special apps needed!** Project Gutenberg eBooks require no special apps to read, just the regular Web browsers or eBook readers that are included with computers and mobile devices. There have been reports of sites that charge fees for custom apps, or for the same eBooks that are freely available from Project Gutenberg. Some of the apps might have worthwhile features, but none are required to enjoy Project Gutenberg eBooks.
