# Promote Project Gutenberg
It is important to get the Project Gutenberg name around as much as possible, and you can play an important role, too. If you would like to support our efforts, you can add a button and/or banner to your home page. Below you can see static and animated buttons and banners that we've designed for you. Have your pick, or better, have them all.  

Please download the graphics and place them on your own site to lighten our server load. Thanks! 

To display a Project Gutenberg button or banner on your page: 

1. Right click and save the graphic that you best like.
2. Copy and paste the corresponding HTML code into your web page, and place both the graphic and your HTML page in the same directory.
