Project Gutenberg offers all its free eBooks in formats easily accessible across tablets, smartphones, and e‑readers. We recommend the use of HTML or EPUB3 wherever possible, and you can leverage email or cloud integrations for Kindle and other e‑readers, and rely on modern reading apps which support bookmarks and more. On the main page for any eBook (example), you can:

* **Download files** (EPUB3, Kindle KF8, Plain Text, PDF, etc.) and open them with your reading app.
* **Read directly online** in your mobile browser via modern HTML5.
* **Transfer to another device**, such as a Kindle, Kobo, or tablet via USB, Bluetooth, or local file manager.
* **Use cloud services**: Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive links are available from book landing pages.
* **Send via email** (e.g. Amazon “Send to Kindle”) for automatic delivery to your Kindle devices and apps.

When issues arise, switching formats or using alternate reader software usually solves them. If you have issues in your browser, using a right-click (or a long-press) to show a menu that says "Save As…" works well.

## General procedure for eBook devices

1. _Save an eBook file to your computer._
2. _Transfer it to your e-reading device._

The EPUB files are great for this in most cases. To save the EPUB file just click or tap on the link labeled "EPUB". If that doesn't work, try to right-click (or control-click, or long press) on the EPUB3 link and select the Save As... command.

## File Format Options
Almost every title on Project Gutenberg includes these formats.

* **HTML5 (online)**: opens in a web browser with simple styling. Use the “Read Now” button.
* **EPUB3 (.epub)**: Recommended for most dedicated devices and apps.
* **Kindle (KF8 / .azk)**: fully supported by Amazon devices and apps; smaller than EPUB in some cases.
* **Plain Text**: universal and lightweight, without images.
* **PDF**: available for eBooks with mathematical or scientific notation; larger files.

MOBI‑legacy, or EPUB2 versions may be offered depending on the original source. More details are available on the [File Formats](https://www.gutenberg.org/help/file_formats.html) page.

## Device‑Specific Tips

### Kindle (Devices & Apps)
* **Use “Send to Kindle”**: Authorize your sender email address, download EPUB or Kindle file to your computer or phone, and email it from the authorized account to your Kindle account. Amazon processes and delivers the book to the device.
* For older Kindle models, **EPUB often works** natively; if not, use MOBI or KF8 formats.

### Kobo
* Download EPUB and **drag‑and‑drop it into your Kobo via USB**. It will auto‑load in “My Books”.
* Kobo’s store includes many free Project Gutenberg titles as part of its catalog.

### Android
* Use your mobile browser (Chrome, Firefox) to **read online** or **download EPUB/KF8 files**.
* Use popular e‑reader apps such as Moon+ Reader, KOReader, Librera, or ReadEra to open downloaded files.
* Calibre Companion or flash drives also work well for sideloading.

### iOS (iPhone, iPad)
* Tap EPUB or Kindle files → “Share” → choose Books app, Kindle app, or another preferred reader.
* For Kindle app, first send to Files → long-press → “Copy to Kindle” or “Share to Kindle” to add to your library.

### reMarkable & Other E‑ink Devices
* Select EPUB, send to **Google Drive** or **Dropbox** directly from Gutenberg book page, then open using the device’s official app.
* Some books may display poorly; try try other formats. HTML is usually supported. Plain text or .txt is the most widely supported format.

## Troubleshooting Tips
* Formatting issues? Try switching formats: HTML, plain text, or EPUB2 may work better if the first EPUB or Kindle layout is glitchy.
* Errors or DRM warnings? Project Gutenberg files are never DRM‑protected. A corrupted download or incompatible reader may cause false DRM messages. Re‑download or use different software if this happens.
* If download doesn’t work via Chrome or Safari, try Save As… / Download link long‑press to avoid browser quirks.

## Further Help
* Use Advanced Search to filter by author, title, subject, language, or format.
* Explore the Bibliographic Record on each eBook page: format options, metadata, subjects, and automated summaries introduced in 2024.
* Browse the comprehensive Help & FAQ section for policies, volunteer info, and technical guidance.
* Contribute proof‑reading help via Distributed Proofreaders ([pgdp.net](https://pgdp.net)). These efforts are crucial for adding new books.
* Support from Wikipedia articles. Some helpful articles include comparison pages such as for [e-readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-readers), [eBook formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats), [Android e-reader apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Android_e-reader_software), [iPhone/iPad e-reader apps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_iOS_e-reader_software).
